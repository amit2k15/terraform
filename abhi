Subject: Key Differences Between Ent Zabbix and Orx Zabbix, Current Challenges, and Cost Reduction Plan

Hi Abhishek,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to provide you with a detailed comparison of Ent Zabbix and Orx Zabbix, along with insights on some challenges we're facing, the business impact if access is revoked, and how we plan to address current VITs while reducing overall costs.

Key Differences Between Ent Zabbix and Orx Zabbix:

Ent Zabbix:

Focuses primarily on availability monitoring such as ICMP, port monitoring, URL monitoring, and synthetic monitoring using VuGen.

These capabilities are custom-built into Ent Zabbix as Zabbix doesn’t offer synthetic monitoring by default.


Orx Zabbix:

Provides a broader range of monitoring, including both agent-based and agentless monitoring (WMI, SNMP).

Monitors a wide array of aspects such as ports, services, network performance, DB availability, logs, JVM performance, APIs, and custom modules based on specific requirements.

Additionally, Orx Zabbix includes web URL monitoring, self-healing mechanisms (implemented for 9 applications with 4 more in the pipeline), which help maintain service availability and reduce operational dependency.

We’ve also automated reports for various applications, generating twice-daily, weekly, and monthly insights.



Challenges if Orx Zabbix Access is Revoked:

Business Impact: If access to Orx Zabbix is revoked, we will lose critical monitoring capabilities such as deep performance insights, self-healing for applications, and automated reporting. This would reduce application availability and increase manual intervention.

Technical Challenges: It would be difficult to maintain the same level of performance monitoring, and we would face a gap in custom monitoring solutions for services like JVM, APIs, and logs. Additionally, synthetic monitoring via VuGen would not be available natively, causing potential blind spots.


Current VITs and Solutions:

We have identified some VITs (Vulnerabilities, Issues, or Threats) due to the ongoing migration from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8/9.

As we continue implementing Zabbix agents across 3000+ devices, we are facing challenges in IP reconfiguration on upgraded servers due to changes in IPs.

Given that peak season is approaching, we won't be able to finalize the migration until after the peak period.


Cost Reduction Plan for Orx Zabbix:

We have a plan to significantly reduce storage utilization by implementing monthly partitions for large tables in Zabbix. We will:

Retain only 3 months of history data in the live database.

Archive older data for up to a year in a separate database to be used for reporting purposes.


This approach will drastically reduce storage costs while ensuring the data required for reporting remains available to the application teams.


Please let me know if you need more details on any of the points mentioned above. I’ll keep you updated on our progress regarding the ongoing migration and the cost-reduction efforts.

Best regards,
Amit Kumar Nayak
