Hi Andrew,

I hope you're doing well.

After I assigned the ticket to my bucket, I initiated a conversation with the requester to fully understand their requirements. During our discussion, I specifically asked whether they had any existing repository for their Terraform setup that I could refer to for deployment. The requester confirmed that they did not have a Terraform setup. I then asked if they preferred a manual deployment or a new Terraform setup, to which they responded that I should go ahead and create a new Terraform setup.

I developed a new GitHub repository based on their requirements as outlined in the incident (INC). Once the setup was ready, I generated the Terraform plan and shared it with the requester via email and Teams. After receiving their consent and approval, I proceeded with the deployment.

At no point—either in the incident documentation or during our conversation—did the requester mention the need for an NSG (Network Security Group). I’ve attached the relevant conversation and incident details for your review.

Could you please let me know if there's anything I might have missed or overlooked?
