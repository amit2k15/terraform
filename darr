Subject: Follow-up on X Server Monitoring Configuration

Hi Darren,

I hope you're doing well.

Thank you for your email. I’ve reviewed the details you provided, and as you mentioned, the X server is an ESXi machine. However, in Zabbix, I can see that the server is currently onboarded as a Linux server.

At present, we are capturing data using SNMP-based monitoring, which gathers metrics based on the Linux kernel from the bare metal server, rather than at the ESXi level. As a result, we’re not capturing the ESXi-specific metrics that you’re likely looking for.

I would recommend performing a validation to ensure that the server is properly configured. We should enable ESXi-level monitoring in Zabbix to capture the relevant ESXi metrics.

Please let me know if you need any assistance with this validation or configuration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
