Hi Karthik/Team,

As per the scheduled change, we have successfully configured self-healing for the following services in the X application:

Service A: As suggested, we have configured a self-healing action for Service A that checks and starts both Service A and its dependent service, Service B.

Service B: We have also configured a self-healing action for Service B. If Service B is down, Zabbix will detect the issue and automatically start Service B.

Please review the configuration and let us know if you require any modifications.

Thank you very much, Manaranjan and Toshi, for your collaboration and support during the self-heal implementation and testing.
