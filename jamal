Hi Jamal,

I have cross-verified the alerts in Zabbix and can confirm that they are not false positives. Upon investigation, I observed a delay in receiving responses from the database. Our Zabbix alert configuration is set to trigger an alert if no response is received from the database within 10 minutes, which aligns with the delay we observed.

Please find the attached screenshot for your reference.

Let me know if you need further clarification.

Best regards,
Amit
