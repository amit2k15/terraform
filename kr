Hi Kranthi,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to extend my gratitude for your invaluable support and collaboration throughout the Zabbix upgrade process. After multiple rounds of POCs on both ProxySQL and PXC, we have successfully upgraded Zabbix to the latest version using a PXC setup. I'm pleased to report that everything from Zabbixâ€™s end appears stable, and we hope it will remain healthy moving forward.

At your convenience, please let us know your availability to discuss the decommissioning of the old setup and plans for managing historical data.

Thank you once again for your partnership in making this upgrade a success.

Best regards,
Amit
