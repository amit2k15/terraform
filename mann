Subject: Update on Trigger Conditions for Service Failure and Self-Healing

Hi Mano,

As discussed, I have updated the trigger conditions as follows for service failure and self-healing:

Minor Alert: Data will be polled every 1-minute interval and will trigger an alert if it fails consecutively for 5 minutes. A self-heal action will be initiated in this scenario.

Major Alert: If the service fails to start in 3 attempts and remains down for 15 consecutive minutes, Zabbix will trigger a major alert and automatically create a war room for further investigation.


Please let me know if you have any questions or need further adjustments.

Best regards,
Amit Kumar Nayak

You can adjust the wording as needed, but this should cover the key points.
