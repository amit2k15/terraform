Yes, Zabbix can automatically disable low-level discovery (LLD) discovered items if they are no longer discoverable. This behavior depends on the settings within the discovery rule and the item's status in the monitored environment.

Here's how it typically works:

1. Discovery Rule Interval: Zabbix periodically runs LLD rules based on the specified interval. If a previously discovered item (like a filesystem, network interface, or volume) is no longer detected during these checks, Zabbix marks it as "not discoverable."


2. Item State: When an item is "not discoverable," Zabbix can either:

Disable the item: This setting can be configured in the LLD rule options, making it so that undetected items are disabled rather than deleted.

Delete the item: Alternatively, you can configure Zabbix to remove items that are no longer discoverable, freeing up database resources.



3. Manual Overrides: If items are manually enabled or disabled, Zabbix does not override this manually set status on subsequent discovery runs. It respects the manual configuration unless changed back to automatic.



So, in summary, Zabbix does handle non-discoverable items according to your configuration, either by disabling or deleting them, ensuring resources are only allocated to items actively being monitored.
