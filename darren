Hi Darren,

I have re-verified the information and gathered as much evidence as possible. After reviewing the audit log for Brett over the past month, I didn’t find any records indicating that he enabled or updated monitoring or triggers in Zabbix specifically related to volume monitoring on the X server.

The audit log does show that he added a server in Zabbix on October 24. Additionally, I noted activity on the X server on August 1 and 2, but no further entries related to this server since then.

Regarding alerts, I found that an alert was triggered on the volume on October 18, which was six days before the reported issue. I’ve attached the alert history for the last six months related to volumes on the specified server for your reference.

Please review and let me know if you need any additional details.
