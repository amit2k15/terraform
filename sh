Hi Karthik,

I wanted to inform you that we have successfully implemented the self-healing mechanism for the following services in Zabbix on [specific environment/system X].

During the implementation, we observed an interesting behavior: when the Infra team stopped the services, they initially entered a "Stop pending" state before transitioning to the "Stopped" state after a few minutes.

We have configured the self-healing to trigger after three consecutive failures of a service (any state apart from "Running"). During the first self-healing attempt, after three instances of the "Stop pending" state, Zabbix triggered the self-healing job. However, since the service had not fully stopped at that point, the self-healing did not work as expected.

In the second phase of testing, the service successfully started after the self-healing job was triggered, as it had fully transitioned to the "Stopped" state by then.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if further adjustments are needed.
